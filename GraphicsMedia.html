			<h2>
				The Canvas Element
			</h2>
			<p>Below is a drawing of a house, embedded using the canvas element.
			<br>It is an example of raster graphics, as each individual pixel is edited and set to form the image.</p>
			<canvas id = "demoCanvas" class = "box" height = "85" width = "220">
				The canvas element is not supported.
			</canvas>

			<h2>
				The "svg" Element
			</h2>
			<p>Below is a circle with text inside, made using "svg," which stands for "scalable vector graphics."
			<br>Needless to say, this is an example of vector graphics, in which information about the elements of the
			<br>image are stored and used to construct the image.</p>
			<svg width = "200", height = "200">
				<circle cx = "100" cy = "100" r = "90" stroke = "#000000" stroke-width = "5" fill = "#ffffb0" />
				<text fill = "#ff00ff" font-size = "22" font-family = "Times New Roman" x = "25" y = "111">
					Vector Graphics!

				<h2 class = "demoTitle">Tic Tac Toe</h2>
				<div class = "planning indent">
					<p>This game has an AI, which if allowed to move first, can win rather often, and it will never lose.
					<br>There are 362,880 (9!) possible sequences of selecting from a set of nine.
					<br>There are 19,683 (3^9) possible arrays with 9 elements, when each element can have one of three different values.
					<br>Due to the impracticality of mapping all of these, a different approach is needed.
					<br>Since a round ends in nine moves or fewer, only nine board arragements need to be considered at once!
					<br>In essence, the AI will scan a tree of all possible move sequences, while only storing up to nine elements!
					<br>To do this, I create a scan function.  It takes 3 arguments:  The desired winner, the opponent, and the current player.
					<br>It returns an array with three elements:  [guarantee of victory?, number of potential victories, possiblility of loss?].
					<br>If the scan function is given a board where the desired winner wins, it returns [true, 1, false].
					<br>If given a board where the opponent wins, it returns [false, 0, true].
					<br>In the event that a given board is not a draw, but not yet has a winner, it iterates through the possible moves and combines the results of calling scan on those boards.
					<br>This would have been much harder if not for recursion.
					<br>In order to optimize, the search ends when it finds a move that guarantees victory, even if a move later in the search would grant a more immediate one.</p>

				<h2 class = "demoTitle">Caesar Cipher</h2>
				<div class = "planning indent">
					<p>The goal is to take a string, and shift each letter's value by a certain amount.
					<br>To accomplish this, I create a more general mechanism, then feed it the specific values I need.
					<br>Specifically, I create a function that takes an array of ranges, each one having a start, end, and amount to displace.
					<br>For a cipher shifting uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters 3 down, the range array will look like this:  [[65, 90, 3], [97, 122, 3]]
					<br>63, 90, 97, and 122 are the decimal representations of the character codes for "A", "Z", "a", and "z" respectively.
					<br>Character codes between 63 and 90 will be increased by 3, and character codes between 97, and 122 will be increased by 3.
					<br>Additionally, if a code is increased passed the top of its range, it is shifted down to the bottom of the range.
					<br>The character character code for "Y", 89 if increased by three, will loop back to the code for "B", 66.
					<br>To make use of this system, an input string is converted into an array of character codes, which this function is then applied to.
					<br>The resulting array can then be converted back to a string, and is output.
					<br>This system can be provided different input arrays, even including ranges that overlap.  The instructions for ranges are executed left to right.
					<br>There is also a function for creating inverse range arrays that, once applied to ciphertext, reveal the original message.
					<br>This inverse function does properly accomadate even more complicated range arrays.</p>

							<td>Shifts the basic alphabetic characters and groups of special characters by 3.  This is the default.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Since the second and third entries in the above list shift each group by the same value, they can be put into the "Basic Ranges Array" field.
					<br>Set the desired displacement in the provided field, then click update next to the "Ranges Array" field to get the new range array, which displaces the same groups, by the new value.
					<br>
					<br>Feel free to create your own range arrays.  They come in the form [[min1,max1,disp1],[min2,max2,disp2],[min3,max3,disp3],...]
